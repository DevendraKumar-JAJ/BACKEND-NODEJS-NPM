# BACKEND-NODEJS-NPM  ⚙️

> A comprehensive collection of backend implementations using Node.js and NPM packages, demonstrating various server-side technologies, patterns, and utilities for scalable and modern backend development.

## 🔧 Features

Modular and organized structure for different backend use-cases

Demonstrates usage of various databases, authentication mechanisms, and real-time communication

Follows industry-standard practices with middleware, error handling, and environment-based configuration

Clean and minimal code focused on learning, integration, and reusability

## 📁 Project Structure

This repository contains multiple independent Node.js modules, each demonstrating a specific backend concept or integration. Each module is self-contained and can be run individually. Technologies explored include:

#### Backend authentication strategies

#### Database integration (SQL and NoSQL)

#### Caching and performance optimization

#### Real-time communication protocols

#### Token-based security implementations

## 📦 Getting Started
